# SpeedyAir

## Installation

<p>
To install this project, it can be imported as a Maven project into Eclipse, or another IDE.<br>
Clone the repo and select the main directory of the repo as the source for maven import.
</p>

## Additional features

<p>
To make loading flights into program easier, I placed the flights in a Json file "coding-assignment-flights.json", similar to how orders are in a Json, and loaded those into memory on execution of the Java Main program.
</p>

## Notes

<ul>
<li>All Json files used by the application are located in "src/main/resources/"</li>
<li>The pom.xml in this project imports org.json from Maven in order for Json files to be read.</li>
</ul>
